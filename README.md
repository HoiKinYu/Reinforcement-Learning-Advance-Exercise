***Executive Summary:***

In this notebook, ***the goal of the Basic environment is to kill the monster as soon as possible***. First, I started with taken random actions ***The reward received in between -365 to 66 (average -121)***. After that, I used ***stable_baselines3 PPO model to train the Agent*** in order to complete this goal. As a result, The ***Mean Reward reach highest reward at 150k timesteps around 80*** (time spend 1hr 18min), ***the agent perform significantly better and it killed the monster very quickly***.
